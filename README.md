# Job-Basket
The single-page app is inteded to allow a user to keep track of job postings they are interested in. Sort the jobs by status(applied, not applied, interviewed, offered, hired), and also add reminders for the day.

# General Info
Job-Basket is a Flatiron School Web Developement Module 4 project to demonstrate working knowledge of drawing an ERD(entity relational database), spinning up a Rails API with all the appropriate configurations(associations, routes, actions), and heavy focus on React as frontend for interactions between user and browser.

# Tech Stack
This web app employs the following technologies(not inclusive):

* Ruby [2.6.1]
* Rails [6.0.3.2]
* React(Components and Routes)
* Semantic UI React for styling
* PostgresQL - Database
* Bcrypt and JWT for authentication and authorization
* rack-cors - provides support for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing for Rack compatible web applications(allows the front-end portion of this project to perform fetch requests)
* active_model_serializers - allows customization and rendering of data in JSON format as responses to requests
* heroku - deployment to cloud

# What's Next?

Database schema will need to be updated with more tables to add more features. Frontend styling will also be greatly improved, and will be revisited in the future after the end of the Web Dev Fellowship at Flatiron. I will be taking in recommendations and tracking the features in the Nice-To-Have section below.

# Nice to have features(not final):

* Adding prompts and validations
* Sort jobs by dates added
* Allowing a user to delete their account information
* Make weather API dynamic according to users' geolocation

# Known Issues so far:
* Weather API on top of app not dynamic to users' geolocation
